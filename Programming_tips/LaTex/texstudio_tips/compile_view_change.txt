To compile and view tex files using texstudio in macpro
=====================================
1. for some reasons pdflatex is taking infinite time to run 
   and computer hangs.
   
   change pdflatex to latexmk command.
   
   Texstudio > Build
   build and view: txs:///latexmk | txs:///view
   Default compiler: latexmk
