1. Make sure that Vundle is installed


2. Install the plugin snipmate (UltiSnips did not worked in macpro.)

3. For example create a file ~/.vim/snippets/python.snippets with contents

snippet #!
	#!python
	# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-


4. To use vi a.py, type #! and hit the tab key.

5. For global snippets use ~/.vim/snippets/_.snippets
