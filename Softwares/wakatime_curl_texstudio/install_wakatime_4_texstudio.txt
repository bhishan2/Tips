To install wakatime for Texstudio
=================================

1. First we should update the curl command on mac
download curl to ~/Applications folder and configure make makeinstall

2. Go to wakatime website and follow instructions
https://wakatime.com/editors

i.e.
sudo -H pip install wakatime   (conda isntall fails, there is no package)
touch ~/.wakatime.cfg
geany ~/.wakatime.cfg

(In atom cmd alt o, then type ~/.wakatime.cfg)

Paste following items on the wakatime configuration file:

[Settings]
api_key = Number  (the number is from wakatime website)

3. Curl and install install.py
Note: downloading the texstudio-wakatime and installing failed.
Use curl command.


curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wakatime/texstudio-wakatime/master/install.py | python

I got error for curl:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 124, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 46, in main
  File "<stdin>", line 62, in build_macro
TypeError: must be str, not bytes

Set python2 and use curl. Then it passed.
However, I had a macro in texstudio which was causing the problem. So I first
deleted the macro and install wakatime plugin using curl and python2.

4. Testing
While using textstudio, you should not get wakatime plugin failed error message
in the bottom message bar.

Error: Could not start the command: wakatime --entity "/Users/poudel/Dropbox/Prospectus/prospectus/prospectus.tex" --plugin "texstudio/135686 texstudio-wakatime/1.0.0" --write --lineno 143 --cursorpos 5256
